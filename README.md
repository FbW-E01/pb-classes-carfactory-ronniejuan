# Car factory

Create a constructor function that can be used to create objects.

The objects your factory creates should all have a "type" propety that always has the value "car".

The factory should take in three parameters and save them to the created objects:
- make
- model
- year

Use your function to create 10 different cars. Store all of them inside a "garage" array.
